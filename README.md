<hr>

I'm Jordan, currently working as a **Technology Consultant** @ Deloitte. I am a **software developer** with a **passion for Web Development**. Whilst my time at Villanova University's School of Business I was fortunate enough to gain exposure to programming, allowing me to **implement custom automated solutions to historically manual financial processes**.

Working full time as a Technology Consultant, I have expanded my industry knowledge outside of finance, working with clients in both the Healthcare and Real Estate Construction industries. From working with **SQL** and **Python** to **HTML** and **JavaScript**, I have been exposed to both the **Front End** and **Back End** Software Development Cycle.
